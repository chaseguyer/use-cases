TODO ITEMS
----------

Add your names to the authors list.

Create and fill in a section in the document. Examples are provided.

Change the SUBSECTION titles from a generic "Use Case N" to something
desciptive.

Create a use case diagram in PlantUML for each use case.

Add the PlantUML file to the project repository.

Embed the diagram as a PNG image into the LaTeX document.


NOTES
-----

LaTeX has a subsubsection, with is used as follows:

\begin{subsubsection}{title}
Text in the subsubsection.
\end{subsubsection}

Also, check the main LaTeX document for individual tasks, which will be placed
in TODO comments. Ctrl-F is your friend in ensuring you've seen all your tasks.
I am going to try and keep TODO items updated here as well, but I might lag
behind a little bit.
