\begin{subsection}{Interact with a Coworker}
\textbf{Actors}:
Player, NPC

\textbf{Goal}:
The Player wishes to perform an interaction with an NPC.

\textbf{Preconditions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player is adjacent to the NPC.
\item The Player has a relationship value with the NPC equal to or greater
	than the NPC's relationship threshold.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary}:
The Player interacts with an NPC occupying space in the World. The
interaction may or may not cause a state change for either the Player or
the NPC Social Network.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
All specific NPC interactions extend this use case. Examples include
modifying a relationship, gaining a promotion, or managing quests.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player inputs the interact command, selecting the NPC.
\item The System performs the interaction, gathing aditional input from the
	Player as necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Alternative}:
The NPC informs the Player they lack the relationship to perform the
interaction (see \textit{Preconditions}).
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{Get a Promotion}
\textbf{Actors}:
Player, NPC

\textbf{Goal}:
The Player seeks to advance to the next level of play.

\textbf{Preconditions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player is able to perform the use case \textit{Interact with a
	Coworker}.
\item The Player has recieved a Level Advancement Quest from the NPC.
\item The Player has completed the Level Advancement Quest given by the
	NPC.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary}:
The Player interacts with an NPC occupying space in the World. If all of
the \textit{Preconditions} are met then the Player is given access to the
next level of play, and is given any corresponding benefits or items.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
This use case extends \textit{Interact with a Coworker}. This case may be
optionally extended to allow for different player classes or alternate
advancement requirements.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player inputs the interact command, selecting the NPC.
\item The System enables the next level of play.
\item The System enacts any appropriate state changes upon the Player.
\item The System enacts any appropriate state changes upon NPCs.
\item The Player is notified of their advancement.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Alternative}:
The NPC notifies the Player of the conditions that remain unmet (see
\textit{Preconditions}).
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{Combat}
\textbf{Actors}:
Player(s), Enemy Entity(-ies)

\textbf{Goal}:
The Player seeks to overcome and defeat an opponent or challenge.

\textbf{Preconditions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player is adjacent to the Enemy Entity.
\item The Player has the Combat flag enabled.
\item The Enemy Entity has the Combat flag enabled.
\end{enumerate}

% NOTE: Whoever does the Player Victory and Player Death use cases needs
% to make sure the System enables the Combat flag on the Player.

\textbf{Summary}:
The Player engages in combat with an Enemy Entity occupying space in the
World. Combat is carried out in Turns, with each combatant selecting a Move
each Turn, which are then resolved in order from the entity with the
highest Speed value to the entity with the lowest Speed value. When every
member of one side has their Health reduced to 0, then the other side is
victorious. If the Player(s) won, then go to use case \textit{Player
Victory}. If the Player(s) lost, then go to use case \textit{Player Death}.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
This use case is a parent to \textit{Combat Turn}. The use cases
\textit{Player Victory} or \textit{Player Death} immediately follow. This
use case can be optionally extended to allow for alternate forms of combat.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player inputs the Begin Combat command, \textit{or} the Enemy
Entity begins combat with the Player.
\item The System disables the Player's Combat flag.
\item The System disables the Enemy Entity's Combat flag.
\item \label{combat:turn} Perform use case \textit{Combat Turn}.
\item If neither side has been reduced to 0 Health,
	go to step \ref{combat:turn}.
\item If the Enemy Entity has a Health of 0, go to use case \textit{Player
	Victory}.
\item If the Player has a Health of 0, go to use case \textit{Player
	Death}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{subsection}

\begin{subsection}{Combat Turn}
\textbf{Actors}:
Player(s), Enemy Entity(-ies)

\textbf{Goal}:
The Player seeks to reduce the Enemy Entity's Health to 0 and keep their
own Health above 0.

\textbf{Preconditions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Player is currently in the \textit{Combat} use case.
\item The Enemy Entity is currently in the \textit{Combat} use case.
\item The \textit{Combat} use case is requesting for the \textit{Combat
	Turn} use case to be run.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary}:
The Player and the Enemy Entity both select a Move. Moves are then
sequentially executed, with the Move selected by the Entity with the
largest Speed value being evaluated first, and the Move selected by the
Entity with the smallest Speed value being evaluated last.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
This use case is a child of the \textit{Combat} use case, and can be
optionally extended to provide alternative combat mechanics.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The System prompts the Player with a list of legal Moves.
\item The Player selects a Move.
\item The Enemy entity selects a Move.
\item The System evaluates all Moves, in order of Speed.
\item The System updates the state of each Entity as appropriate.
\end{enumerate}

\item The Player has a Health which is greater than 0.
\item The Enemy Entity is currently in the \textit{Combat} use case.
\item The Enemy Entity has a Health of 0.
\item The \textit{Combat} use case is requesting for the \textit{Player
	Victory} use case to be run.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary}:
The Player is informed of any Items or Reputation gained. If multiple
Players are present, then they reach an agreement on how the Items are to
be distributed.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
This use case can only be begun when transitioning from the \textit{Combat}
use case.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The System calculates the Items and/or Reputation gained by the
	Player based upon the Enemy Entity.
\item The System informs the Player of the Items and/or Reputation gained.
\item If there is only one player, go to step \ref{player_victory:end}.
\item \label{player_victory:distribute_items} The System allows the Players
to distribute the Items gained.
\item The Players either agree or do not agree to the distribution.
\item If the Players do not agree,
	go to step \ref{player_victory:distribute_items}
\item \label{player_victory:end} Go to use case \textit{Place Items in
	Inventory}.

\begin{subsection}{Movement through Levels}
\textbf{Actors}:
Player

\textbf{Goal}:
To cross the current level and enter the next one.

\textbf{Preconditions}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The tile the player is moving to must not have an obstacle. 
\item If there is an item required to move on to the next level, the player must possess it.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Summary}:
The player will traverse across the level to find the exit tile to the next one. If he/she encounters a wall or solid object, they player will not move in the direction of the obstacle. If the player succeeds in finding and moving onto the exit tile, they will be given a prompt that asks if they would like to move to the next area. If not, the player is pushed away from the tile so they can continue to explore the level they are on. If the player wishes to move forward, the next level will be generated and they will be moved to it.

\textbf{Related Use Cases}:
All overworld interactions are extended by this use case. Talking to npcs, combat, and picking up items are examples.

\textbf{Steps}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The player chooses a direction designated by the movement keys.
\item The system checks to see if the move is legal.
\item The player continues to move until the exit tile is reached.
\item The player moves onto the exit tile to take him/her to the next level.
